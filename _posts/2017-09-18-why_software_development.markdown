Learning to become a software developer has always been an interest of mine. In the past, I thought it was a skill that required a lot of time and dedication, and a required computer science degree to even consider being a developer as a career choice. Being a software developer requires a lot of patience and drive, both qualities that I have. I enjoy helping others as well, and am not afraid to ask questions when searching for an efficient way to code a program.

In college, I decided to major in business management, because I was told that this was the best option for being hired in any job. I was originally planning on minoring in Computer Science as well, but finances became an issue. I began to dabble in programming, by learning basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS online. However, I was never able to take that next step to make it a cornerstone in my life. So far, I have been able to keep a steady progress in Flatiron, and hope to continue this until I have completed the course!
